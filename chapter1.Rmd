# About the project

The course is a very good way to understand possibilities of open science, open data, and open research tools. You can also learn how to visualize and analyze data sets with some fairly advanced statistical methods.

After the course, you can master a few state-of-the-art, freely available, open software tools and apply the principle of reproducible research and see its practical advantages
learn more of all this in the near and distant future ("life-long learning")
